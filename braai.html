      <p>
        When it comes to braai, nothing beats the smell of meat cooking and the excitement of knowing a good meal is coming.
        Not all braai meat is the same, though. This is a real look at local braai meat near me — straight from my township,
        exactly how it’s cooked and served.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>The Cuts That Steal the Show</h3>
      <p>
        Local braai meat stands out because of the variety and character of the cuts.
        From boerewors and steak to marinated chicken, each piece is chosen for flavour, not packaging.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Boerewors – The Heart of the Braai</h3>
      <p>
        Locally made boerewors is thick, well-spiced, and packed with flavour.
        When cooked, it stays juicy inside with just the right bite.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Steak – Juicy and Authentic</h3>
      <p>
        Local steaks are cut with enough fat to keep them tender and tasty.
        They’re simple, honest, and always satisfying.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Chicken – Marinated to Perfection</h3>
      <p>
        Braai chicken near me is usually well-seasoned and cooked slowly,
        giving you meat that’s juicy, smoky, and full of flavour.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Pairing with Local Flavours</h3>
      <p>
        A proper braai plate is never just meat.
        Pap, chakalaka, creamy samp, potato salad, and fresh salads complete the meal
        and bring everything together.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Real People, Real Braai</h3>
      <p>
        What makes local braai special is the people behind it.
        Family, friends, and neighbours coming together over good food and conversation.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>See It for Yourself</h3>
      <p>
        Want to see the full plate — perfectly braaied meat served with pap and fresh salads?
        I share real photos and videos from local braais on my Facebook page, exactly as they are.
        No filters, no stock images, just honest township braai.
