      <p>Are you a graduate who wants writing experience you can actually use on a CV or portfolio? Eat With Phindile is inviting volunteer contributors to write recipes, food articles, and simple cooking content for the blog.</p>

      <p>This is a peer collaboration, not a job. I’m also a graduate building experience, so we grow together.</p>

      <h2>What You’ll Do</h2>
      <p>You can choose one or more writing styles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recipe posts</strong> – from your own kitchen, family meals, or budget-friendly ideas</li>
        <li><strong>Short food articles</strong> – food tips, kitchen basics, food hacks</li>
        <li><strong>Personal food stories</strong> – how you learned to cook, family food memories, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>No formal writing or journalism background is required.</p>
      <p>Every published piece will include your <strong>full byline</strong> (your name + optional short bio + social media handle).</p>

      <h2>What You’ll Get</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your <strong>name and social media handle featured</strong> on every post you write</li>
        <li>A <strong>permanent live link</strong> you can use on your CV, portfolio, or LinkedIn</li>
        <li>Written feedback to help you improve each piece before it goes live</li>
        <li>Experience writing for a real blog, not just academic assignments</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Important</h2>
      <p>This is an <strong>unpaid volunteer opportunity</strong>.</p>
      <p>It is best suited for graduates who want:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Published writing samples</li>
        <li>Something credible to list under “Experience” on a CV</li>
        <li>A place to practice writing publicly with visible credit</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>If you are looking for paid writing work, please do not apply.</strong></p>

      <h2>Time Commitment</h2>

        <li>Flexible and self-paced</li>
        <li>One piece at a time, with agreed deadlines</li>
