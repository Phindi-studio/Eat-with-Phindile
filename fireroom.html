        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In this review, we explore Fireroom’s food, service, and ambiance to give you an honest look at what makes it one of the most exciting dining spots in South Africa. Whether you’re visiting for a casual night out or a special celebration, here’s what to expect.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Appearance & Presentation</h2>
        <p>Fireroom’s vibrant, modern décor creates an atmosphere that feels both upscale and energetic — perfect for special occasions or nights out. The lively yet elegant vibe complements the restaurant’s signature fire presentations, where food is flambéed right at your table. Each dish is designed to impress, blending artistry with flavor.</p>

        <h2>Taste & Texture</h2>
        <p>The food at Fireroom matches its theatrical presentation. From tender, well-seasoned steaks to fresh, flavorful sushi, every bite is thoughtfully crafted. The textures are balanced — creamy sauces, crisp toppings, and perfectly cooked proteins come together beautifully. Their sushi, in particular, stands out for its freshness and rich taste.</p>

        <h2>Service & Staff</h2>
        <p>Our experience with the staff was mostly positive. At the Mall of Africa location, the restaurant was packed, but we were seated within 15–30 minutes thanks to helpful staff who went the extra mile. At Montecasino, however, the wait was over two hours, and the waiting list was full despite visible empty tables — so timing and location matter.</p>
        <p>Once seated, service was attentive and warm. Orders arrived quickly, special requests were handled with care, and the staff even offered a complimentary dessert when they learned I had just celebrated a birthday. Their attention to detail and customer focus made a strong impression.</p>

        <h2>Tips & Recommendations</h2>
        <div class="tip-box">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Fireroom gets very busy, especially at the Mall of Africa branch. Make a reservation in advance to avoid long waiting times.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Fireroom delivers more than a meal — it’s a full sensory experience. The combination of stylish ambiance, show-stopping presentation, and rich flavors makes it one of the most memorable dining spots around. Service can vary by branch, but overall, it’s friendly and professional.</p>
        <p><strong>Perfect for:</strong> birthdays, celebrations, or anyone who enjoys food with flair.</p>
        <p><strong>Rating:</strong> ★★★★☆ (4.5/5)</p>
