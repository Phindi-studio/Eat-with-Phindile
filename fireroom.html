      <h2> Service & Staff </h2>
      <p>Our experience with Fireroom’s service was mostly helpful and accommodating. We first went to the Mall of Africa location, which was packed, so we had to wait for a table. Then we tried Montecasino, where they told us the wait would be two hours and their waiting list was full, even though there were empty seats. Returning to Mall of Africa, we were seated after just 15–30 minutes, thanks to staff who went out of their way to help us. </p>
        <p>The team was attentive throughout the meal. Orders were served promptly, and special requests were handled with care. Since my birthday was the day before, I asked for a free birthday dessert — they gladly provided one. Even when helping us find a table, they made sure we were seated in a spot we preferred, rather than the first available, showing real attention to detail and guest satisfaction.</p>
