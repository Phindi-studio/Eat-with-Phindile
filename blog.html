          <h3>FireRoom</h3>
          <p class="rating" aria-label="5 out of 5 stars">★★★★★</p>
          <p>It was exciting to watch the food flamed right at our table — a real show to start the meal. The dishes were full of rich, delightful fusion flavors, and every bite was amazing. Even though the place was packed and buzzing, the staff stayed friendly and helpful, quickly finding us a spot when no tables were free. The warm, cozy atmosphere made it easy to relax and enjoy the evening. I’ll definitely be going back.</p>
