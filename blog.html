        <h3>FireRoom</h3>
        <p class="rating" aria-label="5 out of 5 stars">★★★★★</p>
        <p>
          Watching the food flamed right at the table set the tone for the entire meal.
          The fusion flavours were rich and memorable, and despite the busy atmosphere,
          the staff remained warm and attentive. A dining experience worth repeating.
