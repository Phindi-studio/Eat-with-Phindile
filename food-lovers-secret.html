      <section aria-label="Introduction">
        <p>The festive season is a test for food lovers — even the most confident cooks can end up with soggy salads, gluey pasta, or dry chicken. These seven kitchen secrets help you avoid common mistakes and turn every holiday meal into a memorable experience.</p>
      </section>

      <section aria-label="Never rinse pasta">
        <h3>1. Never rinse pasta — except for salads</h3>
        <p>Rinsing removes starch that helps sauce cling. Only rinse cold pasta for salads to stop cooking and avoid mushy noodles.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive fail if ignored:</strong> Mac and cheese that separates or pasta bake that tastes watery.</p>
        <!--<p><em>Internal link:</em> <a href="recipes.html#pasta-recipes" title="Best Pasta Recipes">Try our pasta recipes for perfect results</a></p>-->
      </section>

      <section aria-label="Never dress salad early">
        <h3>2. Don’t dress salad too early</h3>
        <p>Vinegar and citrus break down greens fast. Only tough greens like kale benefit from early dressing.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive fail if ignored:</strong> Wilted salad before guests even sit down.</p>
        <!--<p><em>Internal link:</em> <a href="recipes.html#holiday-salads" title="Holiday Salad Recipes">See our holiday salad recipes</a></p>-->
      </section>

      <section aria-label="Salt early">
        <h3>3. Salt early — it changes food, not just the taste</h3>
        <p>Salting meat early lets moisture reabsorb seasonings deep into the protein. Beans and grains are the exception.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive fail if ignored:</strong> Roast chicken that tastes seasoned outside but bland inside.</p>

      </section>

      <section aria-label="Fat and salt as flavor carriers">
        <h3>4. Fat and salt are flavor carriers</h3>
        <p>Fat delivers taste while salt unlocks it. Low-fat, low-salt dishes often taste flat.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive fail if ignored:</strong> Healthy mains that nobody touches twice.</p>

      <section aria-label="Don't crowd the pan">
        <h3>5. Don’t crowd the pan</h3>
        <p>Crowding causes steaming instead of browning. Give each ingredient space to caramelize.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive fail if ignored:</strong> Pale roast potatoes and rubbery mushrooms.</p>

      </section>

      <section aria-label="Store leftovers">
        <h3>6. Store leftovers properly — some foods taste better the next day</h3>
        <p>Stews, curries, and baked pasta develop richer flavors overnight. Fried food and seafood do not.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive fail if ignored:</strong> Limp reheated fish or soggy fried chicken.</p>
        <!-- <p><em>Internal link:</em> <a href="blog.html#leftover-tips" title="Leftover Storage Tips">How to store leftovers safely</a></p>-->
      </section>

      <section aria-label="Pat protein dry">
        <h3>7. Pat protein dry before searing</h3>
        <p>Moisture blocks browning. Dry meat or fish first for a crisp, flavorful crust.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive fail if ignored:</strong> Grey steak or chicken that refuses to brown.</p>

      </section>

      <section aria-label="Buttermilk chicken bonus">
        <h3>Bonus: Keep fried chicken juicy with buttermilk</h3>
        <p>The acidity tenderizes meat, and milk sugars promote browning. Marinate for several hours and pat dry before frying.</p>
        <p><strong>Festive tip:</strong> Perfect for bone-in pieces during holiday meals.</p>

        <p>Food lovers don’t just follow trends — they understand small decisions that turn meals into memories. Use these seven rules this festive season to impress friends and family.</p>
