      <!-- Introduction -->
      <section aria-label="Introduction">
        <p>
          When people see creators working with brands, it often looks simple: a post goes up, a product appears, and that’s it. 
          But behind many of those collaborations, there’s a whole system most people never see.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a platform focused on content creation, I’ve been learning more about how brands choose creators, how campaigns are managed, and why agencies like The Salt play a big role — especially in South Africa. 
          One important insight: you don’t need thousands of followers to work with them. As long as you’re active on social media and create authentic content, anyone — not just food creators — can be considered for campaigns and even earn extra cash.
        </p>
        <p>
          This post breaks down how the process works and explains what it means for creators looking to grow professionally and monetise their content.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Why brands use agencies -->
      <section aria-label="Why brands use agencies">
        <h3>Why brands don’t always work directly with creators</h3>
        <p>
          A common assumption is that brands simply scroll social media, pick a creator, and send a DM.
          While that happens sometimes, it’s not the norm.
        </p>
        <p>Brands care about:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Audience alignment</li>
          <li>Brand safety</li>
          <li>Consistent messaging</li>
          <li>Measurable results</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Managing all of this takes time and expertise. That’s where influencer agencies come in.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- What agencies do -->
      <section aria-label="What agencies do">
        <h3>What influencer agencies actually do</h3>
        <p>
          Influencer agencies act as the bridge between brands and creators. Their role goes far beyond simply “finding influencers.”
        </p>
        <p>They typically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Match brands with creators who fit their target audience</li>
          <li>Manage campaign briefs and expectations</li>
          <li>Coordinate content timelines</li>
          <li>Track performance and report results to brands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This structure protects brands from risk and helps creators work within clear, professional guidelines.
        </p>

      <!-- Example The Salt -->
      <section aria-label="Example The Salt">
        <h3>Example: agencies like The Salt</h3>
        <p>
          Agencies like The Salt focus on authentic engagement and creators from all niches, not just those with massive followings.
        </p>
        <p>
          People trust content that feels genuine. That’s why smaller, consistent, and trustworthy creators are often preferred for campaigns, especially when it comes to lifestyle, culture, and food content.
        </p>

      <section aria-label="What this means for creators">
        <h3>What this means for creators</h3>
        <p>
          Joining an agency doesn’t automatically guarantee brand work. What matters most is clear content focus, consistency, an audience that trusts you, and understanding that brand collaborations are professional work.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Why this matters for Eat with Phindile -->
      <section aria-label="Why this matters">
        <h3>Why this matters for Eat with Phindile</h3>
        <p>
          Food and lifestyle content doesn’t exist in isolation. It’s tied to culture, storytelling, media, and business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding how the industry works helps creators grow intentionally and helps brands see platforms like this as more than “just content.”
