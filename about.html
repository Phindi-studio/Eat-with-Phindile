      <h2>Sharing food, stories, and simple meals for everyday life</h2>
      <p><strong>Eat With Phindile</strong> is a South African food blog for people who love real, accessible cooking — the kind that brings friends and families together. You’ll find honest restaurant reviews, easy recipes, and everyday ideas to make food a source of connection and joy.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-story">
      <h3>How It All Started</h3>
      <p>My love for food began online, watching people review restaurants and recreate dishes at home. The colors, smells, and creativity always fascinated me. One day, my sister suggested we start cooking our favorite Friday takeout meals ourselves. What began as a way to save money turned into a weekly tradition — full of laughter, experiments, and shared memories.</p>
      <blockquote>Cooking together every Friday became our way to connect, laugh, and create memories.</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section class="about-values">
      <h3>Why Food Matters</h3>
      <p>Food, to me, is more than what’s on the plate. It’s how people come together — whether over homemade dishes or discovering new restaurants. Cooking with my sister reminded me that food connects us in ways social media or screens can’t. It brings life and laughter back into the room.</p>
      <blockquote>Food isn’t just about taste — it’s a bridge between people, cultures, and experiences.</blockquote>
    </section>

    <section class="about-purpose">
      <h3>What You’ll Find Here</h3>
      <p>On this blog, I share honest restaurant reviews, meal challenges, and practical food hacks. I also explore how people can earn through food — from cooking and selling meals to creating food content. My goal is to make food exciting, accessible, and useful for anyone who loves to eat and share.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-approach">
      <h3>My Approach</h3>

    </section>
